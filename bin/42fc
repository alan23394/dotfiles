# 42fc wrapper script, written by abarnett

# usage: 42fc [project [project-dir]]
# With no arguments, it runs 42FileChecker normally, using this path:
FCPATH=$HOME/clones/42FileChecker/42FileChecker.sh
# project: The name of the project to send to 42FileChecker. If the project-dir
#	argument is not provided, the variable here will be used as the directory
#	to search for your project, assuming you have all your projects in one root
#	directory somewhere. Note that the script adds a / at the end automatically
#	when looking for your project.
PROJECTS=$HOME/cadet/projects
# project-dir: If provided, use this as the path to the project folder, but
#	still use project argument as the name of the project for 42FileChecker.
#	ex. you can type "42fc ft_ls /tmp/correction" and it'll run the ft_ls
#	checker with that folder as the project location.
