# Use dmenu to select a netctl profile to restart
#
# My scripts used:
#   my_dmenu
#     my wrapper of dmenu, with my default position/color/font options
#   float
#     opens a program in a terminal that has specific i3 window floating rules
#     in this case, sudo opens up really small in the center
# Other programs used:
#   netctl
#     simple command line network manager
#     used for getting network names, and restarting the selected profile
#   sed
#     stream editor, can change/delete/insert text into pipes
#     used to drop the first two characters from each line of netctl list
#     they are "* " for the selected network, and "  " for everything else
#   sudo
#     permissions granter
#

# sed removes the first two characters from netctl, which are "  " or "* "
