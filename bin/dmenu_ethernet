# Uses dmenu to display ethernet interfaces, and offers controls for them
# It can stop, start, or restart dhcpcd on the selected device
#
# Dependencies

#     my wrapper of dmenu, with my default position/color/font options
#   float
#     opens a program in a terminal that has specific i3 window floating rules
#     in this case, sudo opens up really small in the center
# Other programs used:
#   sudo
#     permissions granter
#   systemctl
#     systemd tool, used to start/stop/restart network interface
#   dhcpcd
#     used to start ethernet
#   printf
#     send input to dmenu
