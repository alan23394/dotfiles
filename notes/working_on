Things I'm Working On
	freaking libft
	parabola on x200
	volume keys on x200
	using nvim instead of vim
		trying to become a power user
	moving nvim windows around
	scrolling up and down keeping the cursor on the same line
	raspberry pi/marvin laundry project/sensor project/websites
	use dmenu for my notes right now
		nvim feels like it's working just fine on this scratchpad workspace
		eventually switch to rofi when I can download it
