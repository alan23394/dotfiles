So I'm using a 30% keyboard ([here](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/b614efaa4138c2ad2dcc8af63747641f) is the default layout to give you an idea of what I'm working with) with mod-dh, and as there is no punctuation on the default layer and I've got a space where the b key goes, some changes need to happen. I'd like to move b under e and k under i to free up two middle thumb keys (also those positions are better than index finger extensions, according to [this](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/compare.html) (click on matrix to get a relevant chart)), but I'm worried about bigrams and whatnot being screwed up. Does someone who knows more than me want to offer some help? Thanks! :)
