Things I Want To Work On
	GETTING A JOB
	USE SPREADSHEETS TO TRY TO BUDGET
	READ POSIX PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL MANPAGES
	START A JOURNAL
		convince our kids to start journals
	CHECK OUT EMACS ORGMODE AND EVIL
		maybe it's really good at tasks and lists and stuff
		and scheduling
	figure out if there's a vim equivalent to org mode
		or a stupid plugin i guess
		or if it's easy to write one
	alarm on birth control container
		altoids tin with buttons for setting and stopping
			buttons:
				stop ringing	[SR]
				hold to set		[HS]
				hour up/down
					minute up/down: [SR]+[HS]+hour up/down
			wired to stop when opened
			a little complicated
		altoids tin with no controls, internal alarm
			wired to stop when opened
			port on inside, for time setting
			no visible buttons
			simple and clean
			easy to use, no need to worry about alarm time. it just rings when it needs to
	compile programs from source (i.e. try gentoo)
		try and cut out as much as I can
			even go as far as editing the source
		makes things faster
		better knowledge of system
	set up dmenu/rofi for i3 workspaces
		be able to rename them
		open ones with new names
		treat them like tabs essentially
	window manager that doesn't use X
		not necessarily all the time, just for fun
		maybe I'll like it
		maybe x windows are unnecessary
		maybe I can write terminal apps for the things I need
		temporarily start x
			other tty's
			in a terminal
		things i need
			slack, discord (wooh neat), reddit
	vim-keybindings for i3
		normal mode
			moving
		command mode
			workspace naming/creating
			window opening
			: would be like rofi
	new monitor in x200
		not sure what resolution i want
			currently has 1280x800
				I am pretty happy with it, but it could be brighter
	desktop is home phone
		essentially, treat my desktop like a home phone
			"home" hostname for mail
			potentially irc/discord/slack accessable
			maybe voip? hopefully
			skype
			linux
	hostname/domain name
		things I need to do
			make a program to take all the different options and generate all the combinations of names
			think about onions
			figure out all the things I'd need to connect under these names
				raspberry pi, desktop, laptop, email, personal website, social media
			tier them and come up with hostname, domain, subdomain, extension, and redirects
				hostname is device obviously
					x200, t420, home, tvpi, whatever I do for other wifi devices
					all get ip's generated based on characters in hostname
					personal email as alan
				domain is brand
					ab328, 
				extension
					.com looks nice
					.net would be kinda cool
					.al? looks kinda nice
						device.al for devices
							x200@device.al
							home@device.al
						site.al for website
							relevant pages for subdomains
								home.site.al
								music.site.al
								facebook.site.al
								42.site.al
									intra profile
						come up with nicknames for device and site
							home@device looks weird, and so does alan@site
							they need nicknames
							cool nickname for device that sounds like a brand
								lowercase, ideally 4-6 letters
								based on japanese words maybe that sound cool
									nice sounding kanji reading
										device synonym, something like that
											computer,
										site synonym, something like that
											website, online,
									this can be my new online "username"
										dope
									maybe an abbreviation
									same kana as ending
										ke, ki, something like that
						personal email
							alan@site.al
								@site.al looks really weird
								how many people would I have to tell this
									"and what's your email for the rewards card?"
									"oh yeah it's alan@site.al"
									"that's a-l-a-n"
									"AT site (that's s-i-t-e) dot a-l"
									how fucking dumb is that
							home@device.al
								home email?
									can't expect anyone to actually use this
									how can I make people use this?
										fancy encryption? blockchain? decentralized somthing?
										gpg? that would be dope
										an app?

	use intra api to write a program to tell you how many hours you need
		set up intra api
		get amount of hours worked throughout the month/week
			compare with how many hours are needed throughout w/m
			break it down to multiple schedules
				my scheduler!!!!
				different week plans
					days we want free
						working extra hours at the beginning to get time at end
					work schedules
						working extra hours on certain days to get other days free
					temporary schedules
						create temporary schedules based on curves, see #temporary
		record hours and set up statistics
			set up a matlab database for cool math
