iden linux notes
	nouveau and nvidia
		need all nouveau things, and pacman -S nvidia
		lspci -v should have nouveau in use at the bottom
	/boot is ESP (can be shared with windows)
		windows esp is /dev/sda1
		mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
			makes an EFI folder inside it (may already be in use with windows)
	bootctl install makes boot files
	mkinitcpio -p linux compiles some things
		/etc/mkinitcpio.conf has some modules in it
			may need to have nouveau in there
	xorg log files are helpful
	acpid and acpi may be necessary
	efibootmgr is a super cool tool
		manage boot order
			lets you add or remove entries
			efistub booting
		bootctl install takes care of this
