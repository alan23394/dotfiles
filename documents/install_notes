Avoid Gnome
	Use LightDM instead of GDM
		or, add this to `.bash_profile` in home directory
		if [ "$(tty)" = "/dev/tty1" ]; then
		    startx && exit
		fi

Figure out network time
Make sure to install 'pulseaudio-alsa', 'pulseaudio', 'alsa-plugins'
Also need acpi for i3blocks stupid battery script
maybe amixer or pamixer for i3blocks stupid volume script
	not if using my own volume script, maybe
Keep the synaptics file with my trackpad configurations
Remember 'xterm -report-fonts'
