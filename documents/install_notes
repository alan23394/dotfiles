Avoid Gnome
	Use LightDM instead of GDM
		or, add this to `.bash_profile` in home directory
		if [ "$(tty)" = "/dev/tty1" ]; then
		    startx && exit
		fi

Figure out network time
Make sure to install 'pulseaudio-alsa', 'pulseaudio', 'alsa-plugins'
Keep the synaptics file with my trackpad configurations
Remember 'xterm -report-fonts'

Programs for i3blocks
	acpi for default battery script (plus I use it in my cpu temp script)
		might not need acpi, can get info in /sys/class instead
	maybe amixer or pamixer for volume script
		not if using my own volume script
	sysstat (brings mpstat, needed by cpu_usage script)

programs
	man-pages
